CS236 Projects Overview
There are five projects for CS236 that are each a piece of creating an interpreter for Dat-
alog programs (see https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/compiler-vs-interpreter-2/ for
details about interpreters). An interpreter is comprised of three components: the Lexer, the
Parser, and the Execution engine. In Project 1 you will build the Lexer. In Project 2 you
will create the Parser. In Projects 3, 4, and 5 you will develop the Execution engine.

A lexer is a program that takes as input a program file and scans the file for tokens. The
output to the lexer is a collection of tokens. These tokens can then be read by the parser.
The parser determines the meaning of the program based on the order and type of tokens.
This meaning is then given to the execution engine, which executes the program.
